Poison the Punch
a game by Jacob Warner

Poison the Punch is a stealth game made in
javafx.  In the game, you attend parties with
the attention of ruining them.  Each party room
contains a punch bowl, and your goal is to poison
the punch bowl and wait till a certain number of people leave
leave the party.  However, your reputation precedes you, and
party monitors will be searching for you as you hide
yourself in the clusters of people.  As more people get
sick from the punch, there will be less people to hide
amongst.  Party rooms vary in difficulty by requiring
a higher percentage of guests to be poisoned, and by
introducing new mechanics such as clusters that recognize
you and disperse if you stay in them too long.  The final
level will have guests that replace the punch bowl if people
keep getting sick.
